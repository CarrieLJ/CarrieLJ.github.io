# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to easily review if needed during the course of Coding Bootcamp. I want to succeed in my course, and by doing so, this will help me succeed in my career. If I ever find myself stuck, I can quickly use my guide as a reference. I learned that I have LOTS more to learn, and will need to be patient with myself during this course.
