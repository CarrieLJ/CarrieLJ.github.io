          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is styling an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal Style sheet is embeded on an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element (this will make ALL h1 elements the same)</li>
          <li>External CSS stylesheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file (this is preferred and makes design easier).</li>
          <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>The declarations contain 2 components: propery (ex: color) and the value of the property (ex:blue).</li>
          <li>* is the wild card symbol which adds to all elements on the page.</li>
          <li>A comma between elements will add same styling to all those elements.</li>

              <ol>1. Make sure you are on the branc within command line by: git status
                    Add the changed files in the working directory to the stagging area of Git by entering: git add -A</ol>
              <ol>2. Changes have been staged, now commit to our repository by entering: git commit -m "added CSS to project" (for example)</ol>
              <ol>3. Verify branch is up to date before opening a pull request: git pull origin main</ol>
              <ol>4. Push to feature branch
                    entering: git push origin feature/add-css</ol>
              <ol>5. Open a pull request within GitHub by clicking Pull Requests on the prework-study-guide repository.
                    Then click "New pull request"</ol>
              <ol>6. Verify base branch is main and to comparison branch is the feature/add-css branch (for example).
                    Add a title with a short description of the changes.
                    Click "Create pull request"
                    Merge your changes with the main branch by selecting "Merge pull request"</ol>
              <ol>7. Close another GitHub issue</ol>
              <ol>8. Update your local main branch by entering: git checkout main</ol>
              <ol>9. Then pull the remote main branch into the local main branch by entering: git pull origin main</ol>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. (starts with the "let" declaration; Ex: let myVariable).</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>API's = Application Programming Interface - It provides functionality such as dynamically creative HTML & setting CSS styles.</li>
          <li>querySelector() grabs a reference to your heading (for example), and then stores it in a variable called myHeading.</li>
          <li>The ; at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>JS is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Give your variable a value: myVariable = "Bob";</li>
          <li>Different variable types: 1) String: sequence of text; these are immutable (Ex: let myVariable = "Bob";) 
            2) Number: This is a number; don't use quotes (Ex: le myVariable = 10; )
            3) Boolean: True/False value (no quotes)
            4) Array: Structure with multiple values (Ex: let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10]; OR myVariable[0], myVariable[1], ect.)
            5) Object: This can be everything as everything in JS is an object; can be stored in a variable (Ex: let myVariable = document.quetySelector('h1';) -This can also include ALL of the above examples)</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code (browser ignores texts marked as comments)</li>
          <li>Operator are mathematical symbols that produces a result based on 2 values.</li>
          <li>Strict equality is an operator that perfoms a test to see if 2 values are equal. It returns a true/false (boolean) results.</li>
          <li>Not, Does-not-equal is an operator that turns a ture into a false. When it's used alongside the equality operator the negation operator tests whether 2 values are not equal.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not; common ones: if... else statements.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you with to reuse.</li>
          <li>Prompt() function will display a dialog box (similar to alert() but instead asks for user to enter data.</li>
          <li>SetItem() function creates & stores a data item.</li>
          <li>! = logical NOT (no value)</li>
          <li>Primitive values are immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language; these are:
            1) Boolean type
            2) Null Type - one value only: Null
            3) Undefined Type - has not been assigned a value
            4) Numeric Type - Number & BigInt
            5) String Type - represents textual data
            6) Symbol Type - unique & immutable primitive value; can be used as key of an object property (sometimes called atoms).</li>
          <li>Objects are value in memory, referenced by identifier. Data property is associates a key with a value; it can be described by the following attributes:
            1) value - any JS value
            2) writable - boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment
            3) enumebale
            4) configurable
            5) accessor property - associated a key with one or two accessor functions (get & set) to retreive or store a value</li>
          <li>var = variable</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code is script.</li>
          <li>If statements - a way of introducing decision -making into our code.</li>
          <li>Arrays is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li> 
          <li>for loop used the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in asn array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over; 3 impotant statements are:
            1) Starting point for our loop
            2) Condition
            3) What allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
          <li>Commenting out code - makes it inactive without deleting it (Ex: /* & */); removeing them is called Uncomment which will make the code active again.</li>
          <li>Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() & Math.random() are properties of JS's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
