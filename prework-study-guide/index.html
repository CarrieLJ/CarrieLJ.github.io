          <li>The br creates a line of empty space.</li>
          <li>The a (which means anchor) creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href is an attribute that points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The alt is an attribute that contains a text string that describes two apperances and functionality of the image.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is styling an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal Style sheet is embeded on an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element (this will make ALL h1 elements the same)</li>
          <li>External CSS stylesheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file (this is preferred and makes design easier).</li>
          <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>The declarations contain 2 components: propery (ex: color) and the value of the property (ex:blue).</li>
          <li>* is the wild card symbol which adds to all elements on the page.</li>
          <li>A comma between elements will add same styling to all those elements.</li>
